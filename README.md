# Productivity Analysis and Bonus Allocation
## Determine Bonus Eligibility
1.	Create New Columns for Bonuses:
- In your spreadsheet, add five new columns titled "Bonus A," "Bonus B," "Bonus C," "Bonus D," and "Bonus E."
- Use the following criteria to determine eligibility for each bonus:
    - Bonus A: Employees who produced 2800 units or more.
    - Bonus B: Employees with fewer than 4 days of absence and at least 2600 units produced.
    - Bonus C: Employees with a machinery wear coefficient of 0.40 or lower, or who worked 245 hours or more.
    - Bonus D: Employees with a wear coefficient of 0.30 or lower and fewer than 5 days absent, or who worked at least 200 hours.
    - Bonus E: Female employees with a wear coefficient of 0.30 or lower, or who produced 2800 units or more.
- In each bonus column, display "Bonus [Letter]" for eligible employees, and leave the cell blank if they do not qualify.
## Apply Conditional Formatting
- Apply distinct colours to cells in each bonus column that display a bonus.
- Ensure the formatting automatically updates based on changes in the cell content.
## Calculate Bonus Ineligibility
- Calculate the percentage of employees ineligible for each bonus compared to the total workforce.
- This analysis will help identify areas where employees may need additional support or motivation.
